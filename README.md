# ME3Explorer

ME3Explorer is a fan-made modding toolkit primarily for Mass Effect 3 on the PC. It has limited support for both Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.

## NOTES
This is my fork of the Recent Mid 2016 Stable. 
It is for development of the WPF versions of Texplorer, TPFTools, and Modmaker.
Pretty much everything else has been removed.
